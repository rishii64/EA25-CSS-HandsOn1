    <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet</li> <br>
        <li>CSS Describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper or in social media</li> <br>
        <li><span class="item3">CSS is not necessary</span> <span class="item4">CSS saves a lot of work.</span> It can control the layout of multiple web pages at all at once.</li> <br>
        <li class="item1">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</span></li>
    </ol>
    <h2>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
    <ul class="item2">
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML documents</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file</li>
        <li> The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, <span class="item5">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try yourself.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, appliies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by Javascript. <br><br>
       In CSS, selectors are used to target a special elementor range of elements on a webpage. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element. <br><br>
       There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are the class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.
